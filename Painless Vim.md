# PainLess Vim
### 1. Get In, Get Out, Get Comfortable

We're going to start simple: open the Editor. We can use command 
`$ vim`

[image home of vim]

So let's cut straight to the quick and talk about ''' how to get back out ''', for out you can use this command below 

` Type :q! <enter> `

And then you should be right back the command prompt

- $
    This time we're going to go in armed a little better
    
- cd /Users/RU9946/Documents/Ruslan/vim
- vim file1.htm
- :syntax on<enter>
  and the file should brighten up a bit 
- :q <enter>
  Okay, you're save

#### Line number and Moving Around

All right, now that we've had a breather, lets dive back into vim, Open file again with 

`$ vim file1.html`

and you'll see you're righ back to boring plan text, you can tell vim to color it again with 

`:syntax on<enter>`

But it seem like a bummer to have to do this by hand every time you start, You're right and Well fix that later 

### 2. Moving Around in Vim: Baby Steps

Now thay your're in file. it's time to move around a little bit.


```
       k 
h.             l
       j
```
this is supper unintuitive way to telling keys will move your cursor which directions 

- h move your cursor one space **left**
- l move your cursor one space **right**
- k move your cursor one line **up**
- j move your cursor one line **down**

Okay, Moving on , once you've gotten comfortable moving your cursor around. its time to *edit something*
